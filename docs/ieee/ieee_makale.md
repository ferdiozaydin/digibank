## **Abstract—**

This paper presents a modular, scalable, and secure Smart City Automation System integrated with the DigiBank digital banking platform. The system enables residents to access city services, make fiat and cryptocurrency payments, receive real-time notifications, and interact with city infrastructure through a hybrid-cloud architecture. DigiBank incorporates quantum-resistant cryptography, multi-factor authentication, and modular design patterns to ensure secure and extensible operation. The proposed architecture supports automated routines, IoT-based event handling, and seamless integration with external financial and public service entities. This study documents the system requirements, overall architecture, operational workflows, and design considerations aligned with IEEE Software Requirements Specification (SRS) standards.

## **I. INTRODUCTION**

Smart City ecosystems enhance urban living through interconnected digital services, automated infrastructure, sensor networks, and real-time communication. As these systems evolve, secure and reliable financial transactions become core components of digital urban services. This work presents DigiBank, a digital banking system integrated into a comprehensive Smart City Automation platform. DigiBank handles both fiat and cryptocurrency transactions, enabling flexible payments for city services such as transportation, parking, utilities, and public safety operations.

The system incorporates strong authentication mechanisms, secure communication channels, an extensible API layer, and hybrid-cloud deployment to balance security and scalability. This paper outlines the software requirements, system architecture, design principles, and secure operational workflows necessary for implementing DigiBank within an intelligent city framework.

## **II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

The DigiBank–Smart City integrated system consists of multiple high-level components responsible for city governance, financial operations, and IoT-driven automation. Key stakeholders include residents, system administrators, city infrastructure operators, public safety authorities, and external financial institutions.

Residents interact with the system using a mobile or web interface to manage home devices, access city services, and complete payments. The CityController oversees traffic signals, lighting, sensors, and automated routines. The DigiBank subsystem processes financial operations, validates payments, interacts with blockchain networks when needed, and provides notifications.

The system leverages hybrid-cloud infrastructure, where critical data and authentication modules remain on-premises, while logs, analytics, IoT processing, and scaling workloads operate in the public cloud.
